## Releases

### Release 0: Implement a Fixed Navigation

Start by reading the article on [fixed positioning][].

Edit the CSS and **only the CSS** to make your page appear like the design in the video.

The top navigation bar should be `64px` tall and all the text should be
centered vertically.  You'll probably want to use the [line-height technique][line-height techique] for centering text vertically in CSS.

What type of positioning should the top nav bar have?  Absolute, relative,
static, or fixed?

Make sure the padding and margins are consistent in your display.  The
detail-oriented among us will notice that all of our spacing is formulated in
multiples of `8px`.  This is related to something called a [baseline grid][]
and, like the [rule of thirds][] in photography], is a simple rule of thumb to
produce typographically sound websites.

# Layout Drill Fixed Navigation

## Learning Competencies

## Summary

 Fixed navigation headers, like you see right here on Socrates, are all the rage.  Let's build our own!

At the end it should look like this

## Learning Goal

The goal of this challenge is to become more familiar with CSS positioning.  [Read this article about CSS positioning](http://css-tricks.com/absolute-relative-fixed-positioining-how-do-they-differ/) first.

## Objectives

Edit the CSS and **only the CSS** to make your page appear like the design in the video.

The top navigation bar should be `64px` tall and all the text should be centered vertically.  You'll probably want to use the [line-height technique](http://www.student.oulu.fi/~laurirai/www/css/middle/) for centering text vertically in CSS.

What type of positioning should the top nav bar have?  Absolute, relative, static, or fixed?

Make sure the padding and margins are consistent in your display.  The detail-oriented among us will notice that all of our spacing is formulated in multiples of `8px`.  This is related to something called a [baseline grid](http://alistapart.com/article/settingtypeontheweb) and, like the [rule of thirds in photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds), is a simple rule of thumb to produce typographically sound websites.
